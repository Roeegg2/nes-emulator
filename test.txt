linear/length counter?
simple
they get loaded a value
frame counter ticks them and their value gets decremented. when they are 0 the channels volume is 0. easy.


you have a timer. gets ticked every cpu cycle.
when the timer reaches 0 you increment an index and reload the timer
and then send the value pointed by the index to the mixer, which sends it to the audio thread
