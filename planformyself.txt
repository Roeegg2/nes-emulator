--------------- APU --------------

------ frame counter ------
frame counter has:
1. divider
2. sequencer - loops over certain values/events. keeps track of how many APU cycles so frame
    sequencer will move to next step each time the cycle counter reaches a certain amount. then it is set to 0. 
3. frame interrupt flag


every 2 cpu cycles we clock sequencer.
